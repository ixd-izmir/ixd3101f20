## Description
This course introduces to the field of interaction design. Interaction design is "about shaping our everyday life through digital artifacts for work, for play, and for entertainment". From sketches to digital prototypes the students will be challenged by the aim of using "these expressive languages to develop a much richer digital environments for their fellow citizen" (Crampton Smith 2018).

## Content
This introduction to design for computational media with an ecological interaction perspective. Students will learn the methods and the qualities of interaction design by applying them directly to design projects and training exercises.

Topics include screen based affordances and interface behaviors, mobile app, generative art, video games.

Enriching and practising known methods and tools as:
Design research, Brainstorming, Moodboard, Grids and layout, Linear storyboards, Scenario, Interviews, Adobe Creative suite (photoshop/illustrator/indesign).

Introduce an interaction design vocabulary and theoretical toolkit as:
Affordances, Algorithmic Thinking, Persona, Wireframe, Non-linear storyboards, Flowmap and walkthrough, Paper prototype, Interactive digital prototype.

Explore further tools of interaction design as:
Processing, Adobe XD, Figma, Sketch, Zeplin, InVision, Marvel.

## Outcomes
1. Develop a set of technical and theoretical tools to develop interactive artifacts
2. Apply methods and theories to the design practice
3. Learn to structure an interaction design process
4. Prepare professional solutions to wicked (design) problems
5. Improve social skills while collaborating in small group
6. Develop unique design approaches individually
