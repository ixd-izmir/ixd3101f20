# Review P1: wireframes, flowcharts, task analysis, use cases4
Frequent mistakes:
1. We are not designing yet!
2. Use case are not roles but actions that might be executed
3. Flowcharts have standards to be followed
4. Wireframe should be detailed (explained visually and verbally) and inclusive (all components)
5. Presentation should favour content over form (visual elements should not dominate but enrich the message)
6. Presentation should include all steps of your work (include the previous weeks work)
