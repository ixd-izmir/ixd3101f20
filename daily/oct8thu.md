- Upload one .pdf of your work naming it as follow: "ixd3101f20_p0_daniele.pdf"
- No special characters are allowed e.g. "ç ş ğ ü ö ı İ è é ò à ì"
- The pdf file should be appropriately compressed

## Research (30m)
### Presentation
Prepare a presentation (1920x1080px) including all the work done so far in a single .pdf
- In the first slide include the title of the project, your name, the class, department and University, the date of creation, the date of last update, the version.
- In the second slide include a table of content, what is included in the presentation.
- In the last slide include a photo of yourself, your name and a short biography, a "thank you" here would be nice.
- Add in each page your name, the title of the project, the title of the slide and your name

From now on you will keep updating the same pdf including more slide and new work and increasing the version and last update date.

Upload on gdrive at 14.30.

**Suggestions and notes:**
- Desktop Publishing tools like [Adobe Indesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html), [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/publisher/), [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net) offer an environment that facilitate your presentation preparation. Microsoft PowerPoint is banned.
- The language of the presentation doesn't need to confrom to the content of the presentation, the presentation layer should disappear in the background and your work should be appearing more visible.
